# Koho Tech Reading

Inside [Koho](https://www.koho.ca/) we have a _tech reading group_.

It is attended by _software engineers_, _data scientists_, and _product developers_.

This document lists out the material we have covered.


## The Format

Participation in Koho's _tech reading group_ is voluntary.

Although everyone technical is encouraged to participate, they can choose not to.
(And some choose not to.)


Those who choose to participate can use time during work to do the reading.

(If they want to do any reading at home too, great. But they also get time at work.)


The meeting, for Koho's _tech reading group_, happens during regular office hours, while at work.


The cadence is, we meet every 4 weeks to discuss the reading.

The point of the meeting is to give comments, ask questions, complain :-) or whatever, about the reading.

Every other meeting, the reading will be voted on. (To keep things fun and interesting.)

Which means every other reading won't be voted on. (And is something chosen by the organizer.)
